#Open this project in Godot v3. It wont work on godot v4
#You are only allowed to open "TinyWorld.tscn" or else the code breaks.
#This project is a smaller version of "Godot Theme Park".
#
#This project demonstrates a 3rd person version instead 
#of first person perspective (for those with no VR headset)
#
#The reason you are to open "TinyWorld.tscn", is because of 
#"Global.gd". The current_main_scene var sets the scene you could open
#
#The scene initialises the Player and the variables for saving your items.
#
# when you open "TinyWorld.tscn", please give some time to load. 
#
# Talking with the shop keepers will lag until a few seconds until the game starts
# interact with the shop keepers using "w" and press the buttons to buy items
# Open you inverntory and you can hit 'p' to take a picture, 
# but it will also require a few seconds for completion
